This is the MNIST data set which has hand written digits and we have successfully applied classification machine learning algoithm to recognise the hand written digits

Tools, libraries, technologies used 
python3
Csv, excel
Numpy
Pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit learn (sklearn)

data visualization is highly used to understand the form of the data 

Various other algorithms are tested on the train data to get the maximum accuracies and minimum errors 

random forest classifier prooved to be the best performing algorithm
